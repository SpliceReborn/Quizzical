# About

This is a solo project from the [Scrimba React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact). This means that there were no guidance/tutorial available, but only a
description of what was wanted, along with some [Figma files](https://www.figma.com/file/pQLv7gGurJWIIgRmVnnyhI/Quizzical-App-(Copy)?node-id=8%3A2) for reference.
The gist of this app is to pull some questions from the [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php), and allow users attempt answering them!

## Features

The basic version of the app requires rendering of two pages, a Start page and a Quiz page (defaults to 5 questions). After choosing the answer, the user can
check their scores and restart the game. Some additional features I plan to add are 1) varying difficulty, and 2) varying number of questions.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
